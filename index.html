            <img id="profile" src="assets/images/profile.jpg">

            <p>Nurse by night, programmer by day. I always had a interest in technology and futuristic ideas like flying cars,
                hologram screens, etc. But my parents wanted me to pursue a career in the medical field. I became a nurse
                in 2016 and have been working in various fields - medical/surgical, pediatrics home health services, and
                psycholoyy. I like helping people but I couldn't find a field that I was truely passionate about that also
                helps people. In 2017, I started learning coding on my own using sites such as pluralsight, codeschool, freecodecamp,
                w3school, and other resources. The more time I spent learning, the more I realized how interesting coding
                was. I joined a UT coding bootcamp in April 2018 and that was the deciding factor to finally fully transition
                into becoming a software engineer. </p>
            <p>I did my prerequisites at Lone Star community college and University of Houston main campus. I received an assoicate
                of science at Lone Star before going to UT health science center - School of Nursing in 2015. Graduated in
                2016 with a bachelor of science in nursing and I have been working as a nurse ever since.</p>
            <p>Relevant technology: ASP.NET/C#, javascript, html, css, jquery, sql, LINQ</p>
